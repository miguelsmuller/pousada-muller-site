# **DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION**  
## **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**  
### **INSTALL ALL DEPENDENCIES**
Make sure that you also have **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** and **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)** installed on your computer.
- **`$ node --version`** 
- **`$ npm --version`**

- **`$ npm install`**

<br>

## **RUNNING LOCALLY**

<br>

## **PROJECT WORKFLOW**  
This workflow uses two main branches to record the project's history. The **`master`** branch stores the official release history, and the **`develop`** branch serves as a resource integration branch.

The branch **`master`** is the branch that runs in the production environment. All commits on the **`master`** branch must have a version number.

Each new resource must reside on its own branch and must start from the **`develop`** branch. When a feature is completed, it is merged back into **`develop`**. Resources should never interact directly with the master.

The branch **`develop`** is the branch that runs in the test environment. It stores the latest features included in the projects and which are not yet able to enter the branch **`master`**.
